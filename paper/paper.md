# Summary

Intergalactic is a Python package for calculating the combined contributions of chemical elements ejected during the lifetime of stars present in a galaxy. Intergalactic generates matrices of elements and its output is based on the *Matrices Q formalism* [@ferrini1992]. The matrices link any ejected species to all its different nucleosynthetic sources.

Using explicit (and configurable) values for *solar abundances*, *metallicity (z)*, *ejection rates* and *Initial Mass Function (IMF)*, the code calculates matrices `Q(i,j)` of masses of elements `i` ejected to the galactic medium as element `j`, integrating for a complete range of stellar masses, and accounting for SuperNovas of types *I* and *II*.

For each mass step Intergalactic computes the contribution matrix of 15 elements:

| H | D | He3 | He4 | C | C13 | N | O | Ne | Mg | Si | S | Ca | Fe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

and rich neutron isotopes.

Calculating the contributions of chemical elements from different stars in several mass ranges is a necessary step for galactic chemical evolution models [@molla2017]. Intergalactic provides detailed datasets to use as input or by internal methods in these models.
